            Hi, Andrew here. Nice to meet you. Since beginning my journey as a 
            software developer nearly 5 years ago, I've done personal and University projects for
            my own personal development and consulted for a financial institution. This was all done along
            with talented people to create software solutions. 
            I'm naturally curious and perpetually striving to improve my skills on a day by day basis.
        </p>
